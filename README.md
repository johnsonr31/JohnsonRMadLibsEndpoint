Copy the URL into an API platform such as Postman, then type "/MadLibs/" on the end of the localhost URL, and then add "Mad/" folllowed by 
the words for the story, which should be formatted like this: Mad/{name}/{color}/{noun}/{animal}/{location}/{noun2}/{adjective}/{noun3}/{adjective2}/{verb}/{noun4}
