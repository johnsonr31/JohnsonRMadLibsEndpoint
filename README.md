How to use: Open the project with VSCode and click "Run and Debug" to run the API and have it open in your browser. After it opens, either copy the URL into an
API platform such as Postman, or just continue in the browser. Either way, type "MadLibs/" on the end of the localhost URL, and then add "Mad/" folllowed by 
the words for the story, which should be formatted like this: Mad/{name}/{color}/{noun}/{animal}/{location}/{noun2}/{adjective}/{noun3}/{adjective2}/{verb}/{noun4}

After all of that is entered, separated by slashes, you can how hit enter, and read the story with all of these words added into it.

DISCLAIMER: There is no guaruntee that the story will be coherent after you've entered your words into it, depending on which words you entered.
